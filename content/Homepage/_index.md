> *I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends  
> They're in my head
> I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
> We broke our mirrors
> Sunday mornin' is everyday for all I care  
> And I'm not scared  
> Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God  
>  
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah 
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah*
