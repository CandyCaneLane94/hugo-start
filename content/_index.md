> I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends  
> They're in my head
> I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
> We broke our mirrors
> Sunday mornin' is everyday for all I care  
> And I'm not scared  
> Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God  
>  
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah 
> Yeah, yeah  
> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
> 
> I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
> And I'm not sad
> And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
> But I'm not sure
> I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
> I don't care
> I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good
> 
> Kurt Cobain
